The workshops cover a very basic introduction to *tidyverse* ([here](https://github.com/CoMoS-SA/workshop_R-tidyverse) is the repo for the *tidyverse* workshop), usage of *ggplot* for data visualization and a brief *Rmarkdown* tutorial.  

Files in the repo:
- `data_visualization.pdf` contains lecture's slides. Beside example and code chunks, you can find links to useful tutorials and cheatsheets. 
- `tidyverse.R` contains the R script to reproduce examples in the slides. 
- `markdown.Rmd` is an *Rmarkdown* file containing the source file for the *Rmarkdown* tutorial.  
- `markdown.html` contains the output of `markdown.Rmd`, i.e. the knitted tutorial.
